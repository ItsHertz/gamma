*****************CODING*STYLE************************
0. All C code will follow the GNU style.
1. Function opening braces are on the line after the function declaration, and
are not indented.
 void f()
 {
2. Indents are 2 spaces in size.
3. For all code blocks except function blocks, indent the braces, AND indent
again the code;
 void f()
 {
   if(asdf)
     {
       code;
     }
 }
4. Single-statement code blocks can OPTIONALLY have braces.
Both these are acceptable:
 if(adsf)
   statement;
 if(asdf)
   {
     statement;
   }
5. You MUST document ALL inline assembly!
6. Function arguments are inline, like in C++.

 void f(int arg1, int arg2)
 ===NOT===
 void f(arg1, arg2)int arg1, int arg2

7. Use the smallest integer possible for the job! If you only need to count to
100, use an 8-bit integer.
8. Try to avoid using "magic numbers". If you do, document what they do.
9. Avoid overusing macros.
10. When it comes to speed vs. size, speed wins, unless the size is
unreasonable (>16M).
11. Always initialize pointers.
