Execution begins in boot.s, and goes to kernel_main(), in kernel_main.c.
After that, execution is interrupt-driven, so looking at the kernel_main
function will be pointless: it's an infinite loop. The purpose of the kernel
is to respond to interrupts, from user-mode software, and external hardware,
e.g.: keyboards.
